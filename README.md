# Mover

A Rust implementation of PyAutoGUI, providing cross-platform automation capabilities for controlling the mouse and keyboard programmatically.

## Overview

Mover is a Rust library that allows you to control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. It's inspired by and aims to provide the same functionality as [PyAutoGUI](https://deepwiki.com/asweigart/pyautogui/1-overview), but written in Rust for better performance and safety.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing multiple crates:

- **`mover-core`** - Core types, traits, and platform abstractions
- **`mover-mouse`** - Mouse control functionality (movement, clicking, dragging, scrolling)
- **`mover-keyboard`** - Keyboard control functionality (typing, key presses, hotkeys)
- **`mover-screen`** - Screen capture and image recognition
- **`mover-utils`** - Utility functions, configuration, and helpers
- **`mover-macros`** - Procedural macros for automation scripts
- **`mover`** - Main crate that brings everything together

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Mouse control**: Move, click, drag, scroll, and get position
- **Keyboard control**: Type text, press keys, hotkeys, and shortcuts
- **Screen capture**: Take screenshots and find images on screen
- **Mathematical movement patterns**: Perfect circles, sine waves, spirals, and custom geometric patterns
- **Smooth animations**: Tweening functions for natural mouse movements
- **Safety features**: Built-in failsafe to prevent runaway automation
- **High performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety
- **Modular design**: Use only the modules you need
- **Procedural macros**: Convenient macros for automation scripts
- **Precision control**: Mathematical precision for artistic and scientific applications

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mover = "0.1.0"
```

Or use specific modules:

```toml
[dependencies]
mover-core = "0.1.0"
mover-mouse = "0.1.0"
mover-keyboard = "0.1.0"
mover-screen = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use mover::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize the library
    mover::init()?;
    
    // Move mouse to coordinates
    move_to(100, 200)?;
    
    // Click at current position
    click(None)?;
    
    // Type some text
    type_string("Hello, World!")?;
    
    // Take a screenshot
    let screenshot = capture()?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Mouse Control

```rust
use mover_mouse::*;

// Move mouse to specific coordinates
move_to(500, 300)?;

// Click at current position
click(None)?;

// Right click
right_click()?;

// Double click
double_click(None)?;

// Drag from one point to another
drag_to(200, 200, None)?;

// Scroll
scroll(3)?;
```

### Keyboard Automation

```rust
use mover_keyboard::*;

// Type a string
type_string("Hello, World!")?;

// Press a single key
press_key("enter")?;

// Press multiple keys
press_keys(&["ctrl", "c"])?;

// Press hotkey combination
press_hotkey(&["ctrl", "shift", "c"])?;
```

### Screen Capture

```rust
use mover_screen::*;

// Take a screenshot
let screenshot = capture()?;

// Save screenshot to file
save_screenshot("screenshot.png")?;

// Get pixel color
let color = get_pixel_color(100, 100)?;
println!("Pixel color: RGB({}, {}, {})", color.0, color.1, color.2);
```

### Using Macros

```rust
use mover_macros::*;

// Mouse movement sequence
let _: Result<(), _> = mouse_sequence!((100, 100), (200, 200), (300, 300));

// Click sequence
let _: Result<(), _> = click_sequence!((100, 100, Left), (200, 200, Right));

// Keyboard sequence
let _: Result<(), _> = keyboard_sequence!("ctrl", "c");

// Wait sequence
wait_sequence!(1.0, 0.5, 2.0);
```

### Advanced Mathematical Movement Patterns

Mover supports sophisticated mathematical movement patterns for precise automation:

#### Perfect Circles
```rust
use mover_mouse::*;
use std::f64::consts::PI;

fn draw_circle(center_x: i32, center_y: i32, radius: i32, duration: f64) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let num_points = 36; // 36 points = 10¬∞ intervals
    let time_per_point = duration / num_points as f64;
    
    // Start at right side of circle
    let start_x = center_x + radius;
    move_to(start_x, center_y)?;
    
    for i in 0..=num_points {
        let angle = i as f64 * 2.0 * PI / num_points as f64;
        let x = center_x + (radius as f64 * angle.cos()) as i32;
        let y = center_y + (radius as f64 * angle.sin()) as i32;
        
        if i == 0 {
            move_to(x, y)?;
        } else {
            drag_to(x, y, Some(MouseButton::Left))?;
        }
        
        sleep(Duration::from_millis((time_per_point * 1000.0) as u64));
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Sine Wave Patterns
```rust
fn draw_sine_wave(center_x: i32, center_y: i32, amplitude: i32, wave_width: i32, cycles: f64, duration: f64) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let num_points = 200; // Smooth wave with 200 points
    let time_per_point = duration / num_points as f64;
    
    let start_x = center_x - wave_width / 2;
    move_to(start_x, center_y)?;
    
    for i in 0..=num_points {
        let progress = i as f64 / num_points as f64;
        let x = start_x + (progress * wave_width as f64) as i32;
        let angle = progress * 2.0 * PI * cycles;
        let y = center_y + (amplitude as f64 * angle.sin()) as i32;
        
        move_to(x, y)?;
        sleep(Duration::from_millis((time_per_point * 1000.0) as u64));
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Custom Geometric Patterns
```rust
// Spiral pattern
fn draw_spiral(center_x: i32, center_y: i32, max_radius: i32, duration: f64) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let num_points = 100;
    let time_per_point = duration / num_points as f64;
    
    for i in 0..=num_points {
        let progress = i as f64 / num_points as f64;
        let radius = progress * max_radius as f64;
        let angle = progress * 4.0 * PI; // 2 full rotations
        
        let x = center_x + (radius * angle.cos()) as i32;
        let y = center_y + (radius * angle.sin()) as i32;
        
        if i == 0 {
            move_to(x, y)?;
        } else {
            move_to(x, y)?;
        }
        
        sleep(Duration::from_millis((time_per_point * 1000.0) as u64));
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

# Basic mouse operations
cargo run -p mover-mouse --example basic_mouse

# Keyboard automation
cargo run -p mover-keyboard --example keyboard_demo

# Screen capture
cargo run -p mover-screen --example screen_demo
```

## Safety Features

Mover includes several safety features to prevent automation from running out of control:

- **Failsafe**: Move your mouse to the upper-left corner of the screen to stop automation
- **Pause between actions**: Configurable delays to prevent actions from happening too quickly
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when operations fail
- **Platform validation**: Checks for supported operations on each platform

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Uses Windows API for mouse and keyboard control
- **macOS**: Uses Core Graphics and Accessibility frameworks
- **Linux**: Uses X11 or Wayland depending on the display server

## Configuration

```rust
use mover_utils::MoverConfig;

let config = MoverConfig {
    pause: 0.1,
    failsafe: true,
    minimum_duration: 0.1,
    ..Default::default()
};
```
